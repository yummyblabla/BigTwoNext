As a personal project, I wanted to make a game that I knew very well and would enjoy playing online. As a result, I decided to make [Big Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two), which is a popular Chinese card game that only requires a deck of regular playing cards.

I used PixiJS for rendering the actual game and React for other UI elements, such as login and lobby. Socket.io was chosen to handle and simulate real-time gameplay as players could exchange information with the server and others more easily in a fast paced game.

BigTwo.io has been taken down due to server costs.
